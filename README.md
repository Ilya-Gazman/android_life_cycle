Life Cycle - for android
==========
A light library to speed up everything you are doing.

**Futures**
 - Simplified Singleton pattern
    - Class is a singleton if it implements empty Singleton interface
    - Synchronization of Singleton creation is taking care of by the SDK
    - Singletons are overridable using SDK Factory pattern
    - All the Singletons can be free for GC at once
 - Simplified **Factory method** pattern
 - Simplified Bootstrap
 - **Signals** as event mechanism - It's great because it's not EventBus 

And much more ;)
